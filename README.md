# react-native-multi-module-architecture

Building a scalable APP with multi-module architecture
To build this boilerplate we will use 3 repositories.

* [APP](https://github.com/G33N/rn-mma-app)
* [CORE](https://github.com/G33N/rn-mma-core)
* [MODULE](https://github.com/G33N/rn-mma-module)

This repository has only one responsibility and that is to integrate all modules to deploy and deliver the application
